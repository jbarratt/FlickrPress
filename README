FlickrPress

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install

For this tool, you may want to install in a custom location.

    ./Build install --installbase /home/myuser

would be a reasonable choice. Also, using local::lib is a good option as well.

SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION

You need to configure this using yaml, or it will refuse to run.

In ~/.flickrpress.conf:
    ---
    flickr:
    rss_uri: http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?tags=mytag&lang=en-us&format=rss_200
    authors:
        - myuser
        - anotheruser
    wordpress:
    xmlrpc_uri: "http://myblog.com/xmlrpc.php"
    username: "myuser"
    password: "mypass"

Then, run the included 'flickrpress.pl' script. (It will be installed in your bin dir if you use standard arguments to 'make install.')
It's designed to be run from cron, so by default it's silent.
It tends to die() on various errors, so if you're running it from cron, you'll get the nice error message when it fails.
